# Bulba - A Python ORM

There are a lot of great ORMs out there, so why reinventing the wheel? This is just a small project for my own growth and learning.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For now, you just need to have MySQLdb installed for running this project. Install it using following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
```

Restart your system to avoid any complications in future (I didn't do this).

### Installing

Will update it if need be.

## Examples

Here are some of the examples for running the code, hope to make a proper documentstion if it is big enough.

### Connecting to database

## Running the tests
